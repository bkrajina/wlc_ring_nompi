# WormLike Chain SIMulator

This code is designed to efficiently simulate the wormlike chain polymer model
using various coarse-grainings where applicable.

For very stiff polymers, the usual wormlike chain is simulated.

For relatively more flexible polymers, the "stretchable, shearable" chain is
used.

For *VERY* stretchable polymers, a purely Gaussian chain is used.

## To Run

Simply typing `make` in the top level directory will build the simulator
from source. The executable created (`wlcsim.exe`) will use the parameters in
the file `input/input` and write its output to the `data` directory.
To force a rerun without having to manually delete all the old output files, you
can also simply type `make run` at any time.

The output can be vizualized using the PyMol scripts in the `vizualization`
directory or by hand using the output in the `data` directory, which contains
rank two arrays of shape `num_beads*num_polymers-by-3`, with one file per time
point. Specifying multiple polymers just simulates them in parallel in the same
reaction volume, no interactions are assumed.

To scan parameters, the Python script `scan_wlcsim.py` should be used. It takes
care of saving the current git commit\_hash, all inputs, etc. into a unique
directory, preventing race conditions even on shared filesystems.
